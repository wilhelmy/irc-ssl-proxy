Run "make" and make sure openssl and socat are installed on your system and in
$PATH. Download the CA certificate of the IRC network you want to use, save it
as ca.crt and generate a SSL client certificate as follows:

  $ openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096 # generate the private key
  $ yes '' | openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 1095
  $ cat key.pem cert.pem > combined.pem

Then edit run.sh and change the password and IRC network you want to connect
to, save and run it.

Afterwards connect to localhost, using the port you specified in run.sh (6667
by default) and the connection password you specified in run.sh as password.
You should then be connected to the IRC network securely, even if you use a
very old or simple client that doesn't support SSL at all.
