irc-ssl-proxy
=============

This program is a relatively primitive workaround for the limited SSL support
some IRC clients offer.

Some IRC clients (esp. libpurple based ones) do not support e.g. CA certificate
validation or connecting using SSL client certificates. This proxy asks for a
password, and if it matches the one configured locally, connects to the IRC
network using the user's SSL client certificate.

Requires socat and openssl s_client at the moment.
